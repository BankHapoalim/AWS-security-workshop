                <td align="left">These set of workshops demonstrate concepts of Data protection using services such as AWS KMS and AWS Certificate manager. You will learn about server side encryption, client side encryption - with and without data key caching and how AWS private certificate authority can be used to create private certificates for private domains or devices.</td>

                <td align="left">This workshop shows how you can use an IP-based machine learning algorithm with Amazon SageMaker to augment and enrich findings from AWS Security services such as Amazon GuardDuty. You'll learn how to load the notebook in SageMaker, train the model, and score findings to determine abnormality of the activity.</td>

                <td align="left"> "Identity Round Robin" is a collection of identity workshops covering a range of identity and access management topics. Each workshop can be done separately and there is no dependency between the workshops. These topics cover identity in general, not just the AWS IAM service. To that end you will find coverage for platform identity, application identity and infrastructure identity on AWS. Some of the services covered include AWS IAM, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Macie, Amazon Inspector AWS Security Hub and Amazon GuardDuty. Each round (workshop) is 2 hours long with 30 minutes devoted to a presentation and 1.5 hours of hands on work.

                <td align="left">Your mission in this workshop is to use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), Inspector and Amazon Systems Manager to help build an effective set of controls around your AWS workloads. You will learn to use AWS WAF to mitigate common attack vectors against web applications such as SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting. You will also learn how to use Amazon Inspector and Amazon Systems Manager to automate security assessments and operational tasks such as patching and configuration management across your EC2 fleet.

                <td align="left"> This hands-on workshop is where you will learn about a number of AWS services involved with threat detection and response as we walk through real-world threat scenarios. Learn about the threat detection capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie and AWS Security Hub and the available response options. For each hands-on scenario, we review methods to detect and respond to threats using the following services: AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon Macie, AWS Lambda, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Security Hub.
